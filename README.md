# f80 - Simple Z80 system running on an FPGA

This project creates a simple Z80 based computer using:

* an FPGA development board (e.g. [Digilent Arty](https://digilent.com/shop/arty-a7-artix-7-fpga-development-board/))
* a [Z80 soft-core](https://github.com/hutch31/tv80)
* [Migen](https://github.com/m-labs/migen) hardware description language
* [Small Device C Compiler](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/)
* [SJASM+](https://github.com/z00m128/sjasmplus) Z80 Assembler


Z80 CPU documentation can be found in the [doc folder](doc).

# Introduction

I started my professional career when 8bit computers emerge. Especially
the venerable Z80 (e.g. Sinclair ZX81 or Spectrum). Lately, I wanted to teach
my kids some computer basics and remembered how I discovered how things work
on my home computer, years ago.

Unfortunately I no longer have any old 8 bit machines laying around and I also
did not want to use any of the many available emulators. I thought it would be
better they can touch the machine and could directly see when things change
like blinking some LEDs.

Sure nowadays this could also easily be done with one of the many boards like
Raspberry PI or Arduinos etc. But their internals (e.g. like an ARM CPU) are
not that easy for kids and - I wanted to have some fun too. So I decided to
implement a simple Z80 system on an FPGA development board.

# Overview

The Digilent Arty-A100 was used as platform but any other FPGA board will work
(assuming all needed development tools are available).

The Arty provides some LEDs, buttons, switches and a serial interface which are
used by the f80 implementation

In addition, a 7-Segment display for some more output was added. Either the
[Digilent 7-Segment PMOD](https://digilent.com/shop/pmod-ssd-seven-segment-display/)
or, if you have some solder skills, an
[easy to build alternative](doc/SS7-PMOD.md) can be used. The used type/PMOD can be
changed in the code (see `src/gateware/top` after `Platform ports` comment).

## Hardware

f80 runs at 4MHz (allthough it can run much faster - depending on the boards
clock - can be changed in `top.py` - search for `cpu_clk_freq_hz`) and uses
64kB memory organized as all RAM. The monitor starts at
address 0x0000. Uploaded programms normally start at 0x8000.

Peripherals are accessible through Z80 `in` and `out` instructions using
the following I/O ports:

|Port|Direction|Description|
|----|---------|-----------|
|0x00| In      |UART byte received|
|0x00| out     |UART byte to send|
|0x01| In      |UART status register|
|0xa0| out     |RGB LED 1 red PWM|
|0xa1| out     |RGB LED 1 green PWM|
|0xa2| out     |RGB LED 1 blue PWM|
|0xa3| out     |RGB LED 2 red PWM|
|0xa4| out     |RGB LED 2 green PWM|
|0xa5| out     |RGB LED 2 blue PWM|
|0xa6| out     |RGB LED 3 red PWM|
|0xa7| out     |RGB LED 3 green PWM|
|0xa8| out     |RGB LED 3 blue PWM|
|0xa9| out     |RGB LED 4 red PWM|
|0xaa| out     |RGB LED 4 green PWM|
|0xab| out     |RGB LED 4 blue PWM|
|0xf0| In      |Buttons|
|0xf0| out     |Value to display on 7-Segment display|
|0xf1| In      |Switches|
|0xf1| out     |LEDs|
|0xfe| In      |Millisecond ticks|
|0xff| In      |CPU clock ticks|

The Z80 is implemented in Verilog and the surrounding peripherals are
integrated/implemented using [Migen](https://github.com/m-labs/migen).

# Installation

The following instructions get you going, assuming no requirements are
installed on your system. If some of the required components are already
available then skip the corresponding steps or packages.

```shell
# Install system dependencies (assuming Debian based distro)
$ sudo apt install git curl python3-pip make xxd openocd
# If you prefer 'hexdump' over of 'xxd'...
$ sudo apt install bsdmainutils
```

```shell
# Create project root folder (e.g. projects)
$ mkdir -p projects
$ cd projects
```

```shell
# Install Litex
# See additional infos at:
# https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex
$ mkdir litex
$ cd litex
$ curl -o litex_setup.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enjoy-digital/litex/master/litex_setup.py
$ chmod +x litex_setup.py
$ ./litex_setup.py init install --user
```

```shell
# Install f80
$ cd ..
$ git clone https://github.com/rprinz08/f80.git
$ cd f80
```

For working with hardware you need, in addition to the above, a toolchain which
supports your board/target. This project includes one board/target from Xilinx
so to build the FPGA bitstreams yourself you have to install
[Xilinx Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html).

*Note: Prebuilt bitstreams for included target is provided.*

*Note: Depending on your LiteX/Migen version, there might be a bug
including external Verilog sources
(See [Issue #207](https://github.com/m-labs/migen/issues/207) or
[Lines ~240 in src/gateware/top.py](src/gateware/top.py#L240)).
To fix this change line `dest = os.path.join(build_dir, path)` to `dest=path`
in function `copy_sources` in Migen file `build/generic_platform.py`.*

# Build

## Z80 monitor

Before building the bitstream, the monitor program must be built. It is written
in Z80 assembler using [SJASM](https://github.com/z00m128/sjasmplus). Run
`build.sh` in `src/firmware.sjasm` folder. The compiled monitor binary is then
included in the bitstream in the next step.

*Note: The monitor was used from the [BSX Project](http://www.breakintoprogram.co.uk/projects/homebrew-z80/z80-monitor-program-for-the-bsx) and was slightly modified for f80.*

*Note: There is a monitor version available using [Small Device C Compiler](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/) assembler in `src/firmware` folder. To include this version in the bitstream open `src/gateware/top.py` and search for `Z80 monitor binary`.*

## FPGA bitstream

To build the FPGA bitstream, run `build.py` script in project root folder. To
upload the bitstream to the board used `upload.py`. This is non permanent so
your changes are gone when the board is power-cycled. To make changes permanent
use `flash.py`.

## Sample/demo applications

When f80 is running there are some sample/demo applications provided in
the project (see `samples` folder) to play with. They are written in C using the
[Small Device C Compiler](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/).
For this to work the C runtime entry must first be built.

```shell
cd src/c-runtime
make
```

After this any sample can be compiled and uploaded to f80 using (e.g. clock
sample):

```shell
cd src/samples/clock
make
./upload.sh
```

*Note: the upload script automatically start the uploaded binary. To avoid this,
remove `--run` parameter in the script. Also note that the serial port your
board is connected to must be adjusted in the script.*

## BBC Basic

A version of BBC Basic from R.T.Russel which is now open-source is included in this project. It is based on the BSX version frome [here](http://www.breakintoprogram.co.uk/projects/homebrew-z80/bbc-basic-for-z80-on-the-bsx) and only supports basic console I/O at the moment. So no possibility to load or store programs at the moment.

## Operating Systems

Included in this project is a port of
[Collapse OS](http://collapseos.org/). Collapse OS is a
[Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language))
system including lots of options (e.g., SD-Card support,
Cross Compiler). See the [readme](src/collapse-os/readme.md) for infos on how to
install and use it on the f80.


# Using

f80 provides a simple monitor program built into the FPGA bitstream. It
allows actions like dumping and loading memory and starting programs at given
addresses.

The monitor is accessible using a serial terminal program on the host with
settings 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity and 1 stop bit (115200 8 N 1).

When f80 is powered up, the following output should be shown on the serial
console:

```
BSX Version 0.2
D<addr>,<length>  Dump <length> memory bytes starting at <addr>
L<addr>,<length>  Load <length> memory bytes starting at <addr>
J<addr>           Start execution jumping to memory address <addr>
T                 Memory test RAM
V                 Show version and board ID

All <arguments> in uppercase hex (e.g. D8000,0100)
OK
```

Enter **H** to show some help. The upload function is very simple and uses
direct raw binary data. The utility `tools/upload.py` is used to simplify this.

# Emulator

To ease development or to try f80 without a board an [emulator](./src/emulator)
is also included.

# ToDo

Some ideas for next additions / improvements:

* additional monitor functions
* implement missing SDCC C-runtime functions
* get [CP-M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M) running
